# Weather-website
Imagine a dynamic weather webpage I created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. It displays current weather conditions with animations, offers forecasts, and allows users to customize locations. Sleek design, real-time updates, and user-friendly interface make it a go-to for weather info!
